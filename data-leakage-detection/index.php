                 <p>The data leakage must be detected at an early stage in order to prevent the data form being open source and thus - Our primary aim  is to  detect the agent of leakage and minimise the chances of data leakages.</p>
                <p>We have build an application that will additionally monitor if on the off chance any data has been leaked by the agent of the enterprise .</p>
                <p>It likewise helps in discovering Guilt of Agent from the given set of agents which has leaked the data using Probability Distribution.</p>

                <p> Instead of working out with complex datasets and trying to detect or classify the data/code with machine learning algorithms,We will be using probability measures and hence we can identify both existing as well as new guilt agents!</p>

                <p>We use a mix of probabilistic and deterministic approaches to find the guilty agent responsible in a data leak and thereby increasing the security of data clusters as a whole .</p>

                <p> We shield the data from being out sourced by giving a special inscription to the sensitive data so that it cannot be replicated.</p>
